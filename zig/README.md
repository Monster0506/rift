# Zig Implementation

This folder contains the original Zig implementation of Rift.

## Building

```bash
cd zig
zig build
```

## Structure

- `src/` - Source code
- `scripts/` - Zig helper scripts (capture_keys.zig, generate_keymap.zig)
- `build.zig` - Build configuration
- `build.zig.zon` - Package dependencies

## Status

This implementation has been moved here as we're transitioning to Rust. The Rust implementation will be in the parent directory.
