# Rift

This is a vim-like text editor. 

I use this daily and primarily. 

Implemented:
- Open File
- Save File
- Save As
- basic cursor movement
- insert mode
- command mode

Todo:
- LSP
- Syntax highlighting
- Multi-document support
- :edit filename to open a new document (:e to reload from disk)
- line numbers
- undo+redo
- search + replace
- copy/paste (buffers)
- macros
- notification system
